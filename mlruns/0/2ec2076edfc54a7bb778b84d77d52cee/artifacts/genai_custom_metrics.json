Scores can be assigned based on the degree of semantic similarity and factual correctness of the provided output to the provided targets, where a higher score indicates higher degree of accuracy.","grading_prompt":"Answer Correctness: Below are the details for different scores:\n- Score 1: The output is completely incorrect. It is completely different from or contradicts the provided targets.\n- Score 2: The output demonstrates some degree of semantic similarity and includes partially correct information. However, the output still has significant discrepancies with the provided targets or inaccuracies.\n- Score 3: The output addresses a couple of aspects of the input accurately, aligning with the provided targets. However, there are still omissions or minor inaccuracies.\n- Score 4: The output is mostly correct. It provides mostly accurate information, but there may be one or more minor omissions or inaccuracies.\n- Score 5: The output is correct. It demonstrates a high degree of accuracy and semantic similarity to the targets.","examples":[{"grading_context":{"targets":"MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle.
